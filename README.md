Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the directory.

Run `python manage.py runserver`

Connect on `127.0.0.1:8000/` in the browser.

# To implement

Create cart page with submit button which will send admin an email regarding the order

Create cart so that orders can be stored

Create contact page with email updates.
